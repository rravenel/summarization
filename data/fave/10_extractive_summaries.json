Treatment strategies are tailored to the specific autoimmune disease, its stage, and the patient's symptoms, with the primary goal being to reduce inflammation and minimize symptoms.\n\nRukhshanda Nosheen et al.

The pulmonary capillary endothelial cells abut against one another at fairly loose junctions that are of the order of 5 nm wide. These junctions permit the passage of quite large molecules and the pulmonary lymph contains albumin at about half the concentration in plasma. The epithelial cells meet at tight junctions with a gap of only about 1 nm.

Cardiac and renal edemas typically exhibit a mixed interstitial and alveolar transudation, often accompanied by pleural effusions and an increased heart size (Christe & Vock, 2004). In contrast, injury edema, which is associated with diffuse alveolar damage, tends to show airspace consolidation primarily in the periphery of the lung, indicating a different distribution pattern (Christe & Vock, 2004). This suggests that the underlying cause of the edema plays a significant role in its distribution.\n\nMoreover, the anatomical and physiological aspects of the lungs contribute to this phenomenon. The pulmonary lymphatic system is well-developed and drains interstitial fluid towards the hilum, which may explain the tendency for edema to accumulate in this area (Nunn, 1987). The lymphatic vessels, while not visible at the alveolar level, are associated with bronchioles and facilitate the movement of fluid, potentially leading to a greater concentration of edema in the hilar region (Nunn, 1987).\n\nAdditionally, the distribution of pulmonary edema can be influenced by gravitational factors. Cardiac edema, for instance, often shows a gravitational distribution, while renal edema tends to have a more central distribution, further supporting the idea that the hilum is a common site for edema accumulation (Christe & Vock, 2004).\n\nIn summary, the tendency for pulmonary edema to occur in the hilar area rather than the periphery can be attributed to the types of edema present, the anatomical drainage mechanisms of the lungs, and the influence of gravitational factors on fluid distribution. These insights highlight the complex interplay between physiological processes and pathological conditions in determining the localization of pulmonary edema."}, {"papers": [{"metadata": {"year": 2010}, "authors": ["Chunyan  He", "Abrar A.  Qureshi", "Jiali  Han"], "summary": "Ultraviolet (UV)-induced oxidative stress has been implicated in skin carcinogenesis [1]. Several antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT), counteract oxidative damage and constitute a primary defense against oxidative stress. GPX is a soluble selenoprotein that reduces H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides to H2O, and GPX1 is the most abundant and ubiquitous intracellular isoform [1]. GPX1 activity is not strongly affected by UV and is considered to be the most important antioxidant enzyme defense mechanism in the skin [2]. CAT is a heme enzyme that neutralizes reactive oxygen species by converting H2O2 to H2O and O2. CAT activity in the skin is significantly reduced after exposure to UV [2], which suggests its effect may be prone to effect modification by environmental factors. \n \nInherited variants in the encoding genes that affect the activity or expression of these antioxidant enzymes are hypothesized to modulate oxidative stress and thus influence skin cancer risk. A polymorphism in the GPX1 gene (Pro198Leu, rs1050450) and a polymorphism in the promoter region of the CAT gene (C-262T, rs1001179) have been shown to be associated with lower enzyme activities of their encoded enzymes [3, 4]. To test our main hypothesis that these two genetic polymorphisms are associated with skin cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study of Caucasians (218 melanoma, 285 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 300 basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cases, and 870 age-matched controls) within the Nurses\u2019 Health Study. We further investigated potential gene-environment interactions between these polymorphisms and lifestyle factors such as dietary antioxidant intake and sun exposure related risk factors. A detailed description of the characteristics of cases and controls was published previously [5]. Information on dietary intake was collected prospectively by food-frequency questionnaires, and total-energy-adjusted cumulative average of dietary intake was used to reduce within-person variation and represent long-term dietary intake [6]. \n \nWe genotyped the two single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1050450 and rs1001179) by the 5\u2032 nuclease assay (TaqMan\u00ae) in 384-well format, using the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The distributions of genotypes for the two SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among controls (p=0.94, 0.83, respectively). We compared the cases of each type of skin cancer to the common control series. We used unconditional multivariate logistic regression to model the association between genetic polymorphisms and skin cancer risk and to estimate multivariate Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). To test statistical significance of gene-environmental interactions, we used dominant model for genotypes and dichotomized environmental exposures as low versus high based on median values among controls. We tested the statistical significance of a single multiplicative interaction term. \n \nIn the main effect analysis (Table 1), we observed that the GPX1 198 Leu/Leu genotype was significantly associated with a two-fold increased risk of melanoma (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.22\u20133.72), after adjustment for age and other covariates. No association was found between this polymorphism and SCC or BCC risk, which was consistent with one previous study [7]. This polymorphism has been shown to be associated with lung cancer [8] and breast cancer [3] previously. We did not observe significant association between the CAT C-262T polymorphism and the risk of any type of skin cancer. \n \n \n \nTable 1 \n \nAssociation between GPX Pro198Leu and CAT C-262T genetic polymorphisms and skin cancer risk a \n \n \n \nAs exploratory analyses, we further tested gene-environment interactions between the genetic variants and lifestyle factors that modulate oxidative stress. We found the association between the CAT C-262T polymorphism and melanoma risk was significantly modified by history of severe sunburns (p for interaction, 0.008, Table 2), a variable combining exposure intensity and biological response to sun exposure. The positive association between history of severe sunburns and melanoma risk was restricted to T carriers (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.02\u20132.92), compared to women with CC genotype (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.63\u20131.69). We also observed a significant gene-diet interaction between the CAT C-262T polymorphism and total carotenoid intake on melanoma risk (p for interaction, 0.01). The inverse association of total carotenoid intake with melanoma risk was limited among women with CC genotype (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41\u20130.97), whereas no association was observed among T carriers (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.77\u20131.97). Inconsistent results were reported on the relationship between dietary carotenoid intake and melanoma risk in several previous case-control studies. An inverse association between the intake and the risk of melanoma was observed in some studies [9], but not in other studies [10]. Our results suggest that the inconsistency in the literature may reflect a potential gene-diet interaction. As we tested different genetic polymorphisms, multiple environmental exposures and dietary factors, and three types of skin cancer, multiple testing in our study may lead to false positive results. Replications in independent studies are needed to validate these results. No significant interactions were observed between the GPX1 polymorphism and these lifestyle factors on melanoma risk. We did not observe any significant interaction between these genetic variants and environmental exposures on the risk of SCC or BCC. \n \n \n \nTable 2 \n \nInteraction between the CAT C-262T genetic polymorphism and history of severe sunburns and total carotenoid intake on melanoma risk \n \n \n \nIn summary, we first observed the GPX1 198 Leu/Leu genotype was significantly associated with a two-fold increased risk of melanoma, and the association between the CAT C-262T polymorphism and melanoma risk was significantly modified by history of severe sunburns and total carotenoid intake.

Chunyan He et al. (2010) emphasize that UV exposure leads to oxidative stress, which is a critical factor in skin carcinogenesis. They identify key antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT), as primary defenders against oxidative damage. Notably, GPX1 is highlighted as the most crucial antioxidant enzyme in the skin, with its activity remaining relatively stable despite UV exposure, while CAT activity is significantly diminished post-UV exposure, indicating its vulnerability to environmental factors (He et al., 2010).\n\nGenetic factors also play a role in skin cancer risk, as certain polymorphisms in the GPX1 and CAT genes have been associated with altered enzyme activities and, consequently, skin cancer susceptibility. For instance, the GPX1 198 Leu/Leu genotype is linked to a two-fold increased risk of melanoma (He et al., 2010). Furthermore, interactions between these genetic variants and lifestyle factors, such as dietary antioxidant intake and sun exposure, suggest a complex interplay that influences skin cancer risk (He et al., 2010).\n\nRobbins and Zhao (2011) further support the notion that antioxidant enzyme expression is often reduced in skin diseases, leading to increased oxidative stress and disease progression. They propose that enhancing antioxidant defenses, either through topical applications or dietary supplementation, could serve as a preventive strategy against skin cancer (Robbins & Zhao, 2011).\n\nAdditionally, Sable and Shields (2023) note that antioxidants can inhibit cellular damage from free radicals and potentially prevent DNA damage due to UV radiation, reinforcing the protective role of antioxidants in skin cancer prevention (Sable & Shields, 2023). The literature suggests that a well-organized antioxidant network in the skin is essential for counteracting oxidative stress and preventing carcinogenesis (Briganti & Picardo, 2003).\n\nIn summary, the evidence indicates that antioxidant enzymes are vital in protecting against skin cancer by counteracting oxidative stress from UV exposure. Genetic variations affecting these enzymes, along with lifestyle factors, further modulate this risk, highlighting the importance of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors in skin cancer prevention."}, {"papers": [{"metadata": {"year": 2022}, "authors": ["Madeline E.

They argue that policies aimed at improving access to low-income jobs, while managing competition, can help bridge the existing inequality gap in commuting behavior (Boer Cui et al., 2019).\n\nFurther supporting this, Soltani and Esmaeili Ivaki (2011) point out that vulnerable populations often reside in areas with poor public transport services, leading to inequitable access to essential services (Soltani & Esmaeili Ivaki, 2011). They advocate for transit equity evaluations to ensure that the needs of disadvantaged groups are met (Soltani & Esmaeili Ivaki, 2011). Mignot (2004) also highlights the importance of universal accessibility, particularly for low-income individuals, and notes that disparities in access to transport can exacerbate social inequalities (Mignot, 2004).\n\nMoreover, Lewis (2011) connects personal mobility and accessibility to broader issues of poverty and social exclusion, indicating that transport policies must consider equity alongside efficiency (Lewis, 2011). Caubel (2005) reinforces this notion by discussing the need for urban transport policies to address accessibility disparities, particularly for underprivileged populations (Caubel, 2005).\n\nIn a more recent approach, Pramanik et al.

Their analysis indicates that tram systems can generate a substantial number of trips, enhancing the overall efficiency of urban transport (Choia et al., 2022).\n\nAdditionally, Soberman and Miller (1999) discuss the concept of \"full cost pricing\" in transportation, which aims to incorporate environmental costs into fare structures.

Different time horizons can be employed when studying employee engagement and organizational performance.", "summary_abstract": null, "summary_extract": "The exploration of time horizons in project management research, particularly concerning employee engagement and organizational performance, reveals a multifaceted understanding of how temporal factors influence organizational dynamics. Ancona et al. (2001) emphasize the significance of temporal research as a powerful tool for assessing organizational phenomena, suggesting that examining time can provide deeper insights into decision-making, group performance, and organizational transformation. They introduce concepts such as pacing, timing, and sequencing, which are essential for understanding these dynamics.\n\nEbert and Piehl (1973) further contribute to this discourse by presenting empirical evidence that highlights the importance of the time frame in achieving organizational goals. They analyze how organizational climate can influence decision-makers' time horizons, suggesting that both short and long-term perspectives are crucial for effective management.\n\nBrodsky and DeVoe (2013) underscore the omnipresence of temporal factors in daily organizational processes, reinforcing the idea that time significantly impacts various organizational behaviors. Basu and Maciejewski (2019) add a practical dimension by discussing the necessity of carefully considering time horizons in comparative outcomes and cost-effectiveness analyses, indicating that the duration of assessment can affect the interpretation of results.\n\nBluedorn and Denhardt (1988) introduce a broader view by discussing the relevance of time at both macro and micro levels in organizational research, linking it to areas such as organizational culture and strategic planning. They advocate for a more systematic approach to studying time in management contexts.\n\nLee and Liebenau (1999) critique the existing body of research, noting a lack of systematic studies on time despite its critical role in understanding organizational actions and culture. They propose a classification scheme that distinguishes between different concepts of time and their roles in research design, which could guide future studies.\n\nBrunelle (2017) consolidates various theoretical perspectives on time, arguing for its centrality in organizational research. He highlights the need to consider time as a focal point in investigations to deepen understanding of organizational issues.\n\nLastly, Chastain (1982) points out the tension between the pressures for immediate results and the necessity of balancing near-term and long-term factors, suggesting that organizations often overemphasize short-term outcomes.\n\nCollectively, these claims illustrate that time horizons are not merely a methodological consideration but a critical lens through which organizational phenomena can be understood, analyzed, and improved. The interplay of different temporal perspectives can significantly influence both research outcomes and practical management strategies."}]
