Autoimmune diseases arise when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, a phenomenon often linked to a loss of self-tolerance (E. Choi, 2012). This loss can be influenced by a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and immunological abnormalities, such as the decline of regulatory T cells with age (G. Panayi, 1976).\n\nThe clinical manifestations of autoimmune disorders are diverse and can vary significantly depending on the specific disease and the degree of inflammation involved (Angela Richard-Eaglin & Benjamin A Smallheer, 2018). Common examples include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes, among others (Rukhshanda Nosheen et al., 2021; E. Choi, 2012). The symptoms can lead to chronic morbidity and disability, affecting approximately 6% of the population (E. Choi, 2012; Sue R. Beers, 2001).\n\nTreatment strategies for autoimmune diseases are tailored to the individual, focusing on reducing inflammation, alleviating symptoms, and preventing relapses (Angela Richard-Eaglin & Benjamin A Smallheer, 2018). The complexity of these disorders necessitates a nuanced approach, as the immune system's overactivity can lead to significant tissue damage (Rukhshanda Nosheen et al., 2021).\n\nIn summary, autoimmune diseases represent a significant health challenge characterized by the immune system's failure to distinguish between self and non-self, leading to a range of debilitating conditions that require careful management and treatment."}, {"papers": [{"metadata": {"year": 1990}, "authors": ["J.
